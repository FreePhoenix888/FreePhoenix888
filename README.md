<h2>‚≠êÔ∏è High Case Retail Shop (March 2024-still do)</h2>
<p>
  A Retail Shop that needed the whole project to be written from scratch. A
  projects consists of postgresql database, a website for administrating (CRM),
  store - a website to be used on "vending machines" and machines of
  cashiers/administrators, software for working with printers and other
  software...
</p>
<p>
  Refactored code, added features, fixed bugs.
The most memorable of the new features: a visual manager for languages and translations; document printing.
